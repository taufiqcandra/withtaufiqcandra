## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Tech Product Manager in Indonesia. Currently, I'm learning how to code. I have a passion for working with data, including tasks like data cleaning, data visualization, and creating dashboards. It's super cool to uncover insights from data! Right now, I'm diving deeper into data science by picking up programming languages. I really dig SQL and Python, especially when I'm tackling tough problems and figuring them out on my own.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and SQL.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my skills in data analytical tools such as Excel, PowerBI, and Tableau.
- ðŸ˜€ In my free time, I enjoy reading and calculating Fibonacci series.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about fountain pens.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've completed 15 out of 24 books for this year's reading challenge (67% completion).
